# Functional Node Express Starter

This is a simple(ish) example of a NodJS app with Express that is written in as functional a way as I can...for now. It's also a work in progress ðŸ™ƒ

If you are looking for a more common NodeJS REST API check out the [original](https://github.com/moosch/node-express-starter)

If you are new to Functional Programming I'd suggest not bothering with this yet. Google functional programming and do a bunch of reading and practice before attempting a REST API in Node. I've listed some resources (link to links in readme)

## FP Rules

This server follows some fairly strict rules where possible:
* Only pure functions
* Immutability
* Haskell level logging
* No nested property access (except external module method calls)
* Do throwing
* No mocking

# Todo

* Add all the test
* Make starting of the server more "pure"
